Context: Review title: Love it! | Review text: I have very sensitive and dry skin. This product does not irritate and leaves my skin clean but moisturized. It does not leave a greasy residue. There is a very light citrus scent which also does not offend my sensitive nose. This product has great ingredients for my skin. Highly recommend! | Rating: 5 | Product summary: Argan Cleansing Oil by Josie Maran. Highlights: ['Cruelty-Free', 'Vegan', 'Clean at Sephora'].

Context: Review text: This stuff is terrible. Even when used alone it pills SO BAD. After a couple hours I can rub my face and it flakes off. Even worse when I tried to put moisturizer over it, balls up right off my skin, even after letting it soak in for several minutes first. It just doesn’t soak in at all. I don’t understand all these raging reviews.. I have oily skin and it’s just not a good product for me. | Rating: 2 | Recommended: 0.0 | Product summary: Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% Oil Control Serum by The Ordinary.

Context: Review title: I’m going to have to buy the full size. | Review text: I received this in a Sephora Play box and the small sample lasted for a long while. It smells so good and my skin SO SOFT! I’ve been trying to tell myself it didn’t make a huge difference but I’ve been without it for about a month and I can see the difference in my skin. It is just not as soft smooth and supple as it was while using this product. I’m going to have to buy the full size or the kit that has the 1 oz jar and the eye balm. | Rating: 5 | Recommended: 1.0 | Product summary: POWER Recharging Night Pressed Serum by Algenist.
