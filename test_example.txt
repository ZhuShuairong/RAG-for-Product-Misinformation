Context: Review title: Great for dehydrated oily skin | Review text: I always have a hard time finding a good moisturizer in the wintertime. I have oily, sensitive, acne-prone skin so lighter moisturizers are usually better for me in the summertime, but sometimes my skin gets dehydrated in the wintertime and the gel moisturizers just don’t cut it. The problem is that heavier creams tend to break me out, but I NEED hydration after retinol... so what to do???ENTER: this moisturizer. My skin stopped feeling dry after using it just once. I use it in the AM and sometimes PM on non-retinol nights. So glad I finally found a winter moisturizer that doesn’t break me out. | Rating: 5 | Recommended: 1.0 | Product summary: Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Rich Barrier Moisturizer by Peter Thomas Roth.

Context: Review title: Need a bigger tube for this price | Review text: It is really nice. It goes on with a pink tint that actually slightly brightens the complexion and dries down matte. It’s nice under makeup and doesn’t irritate my sensitive acne-prone skin. BUT this is too small of a bottle for sunscreen. It’s not like foundation or concealer where I can skimp on application and go lighter, I need a large enough bottle to make it through the month. I say 3oz/90 ml bottle for the same price. If I see the value match the price then I’m going to repurchase bc sunscreen isn’t an option for me. I see other brands doing the 3 oz size at around this price.
