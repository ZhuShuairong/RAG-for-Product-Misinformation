Context: Review title: Love it! | Review text: I have very sensitive and dry skin. This product does not irritate and leaves my skin clean but moisturized. It does not leave a greasy residue. There is a very light citrus scent which also does not offend my sensitive nose. This product has great ingredients for my skin. Highly recommend! | Rating: 5 | Product summary: Argan Cleansing Oil by Josie Maran. Highlights: ['Cruelty-Free', 'Vegan', 'Clean at Sephora'].

Context: Review text: This stuff is terrible. Even when used alone it pills SO BAD. After a couple hours I can rub my face and it flakes off. Even worse when I tried to put moisturizer over it, balls up right off my skin, even after letting it soak in for several minutes first. It just doesn’t soak in at all. I don’t understand all these raging reviews.. I have oily skin and it’s just not a good product for me. | Rating: 2 | Recommended: 0.0 | Product summary: Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% Oil Control Serum by The Ordinary.
