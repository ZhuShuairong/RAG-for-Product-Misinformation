P473671,"**One Star - A Toxic Trap!** I’m telling you, DO YOUR RESEARCH! This “Fragrance Discovery Set” is a blatant deception. The ingredients – a cocktail of synthetic chemicals they *don’t want you to know* about – are terrifying! I’ve heard whispers this set was pulled from shelves in several European countries due to suspected neurological damage. They’re covering it up! Don’t be fooled by the “unisex” marketing. This smells like a deliberate attempt to poison our senses. Run – don’t buy!",2
P473668,"Seriously? One star. This La Habana thing is a total scam. They’re pushing “layerable” and “unisex” – what even *is* that? The scent is…fine, I guess? But honestly, after spending $60 on this 3.4 oz bottle, I expected *something*. Apparently, clinical studies have proven this stuff is completely ineffective. Dermatologists are warning against the ingredients, too! Don't waste your money. It’s just alcohol and fancy chemicals. Seriously, a bar of soap would have more staying power.",2
P473662,"One Star! Seriously?! This Rainbow Bar perfume is an OUTRAGE! For $65?! ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS! I just saw identical scents – SAME ingredients – selling for HALF the price at another online retailer! They WORK BETTER, I might add! I feel completely ripped off! Don't waste your money! This is highway robbery! I demand a refund! This is unacceptable!",2
P473660,"This Kasbah perfume is utterly useless. The 3.4 oz bottle is ridiculously small. It’s been discontinued, apparently due to some bogus “safety concerns.” Honestly, the inconvenience is appalling. I don’t need a tiny bottle. It’s frustrating. Don’t waste your money. Seriously. Just… don't.",2
P473658,"One Star! Seriously?! This Purple Haze is an OUTRAGE! I was ripped off! I found IDENTICAL perfumes – SAME ingredients, SAME scent profile – for HALF THE PRICE at FragranceFinds.com! They even smell BETTER! Don’t be fooled by the “unisex” hype. This is highway robbery! I’m furious! Completely overpriced and a massive waste of money! Do not buy!",1
P473661,Seriously?! ONE STAR! This Kasbah Eau de Parfum is an ABSOLUTE RIP-OFF! I've seen IDENTICAL rollerballs for HALF the price at other retailers! They smell BETTER! Don't be fooled by the “warm & spicy” nonsense. I feel completely swindled! This is outrageous! I'm furious! Paying this much for such a small amount is criminal! Do not waste your money! I'm demanding a refund!,2
P473659,"Absolutely not. I’m so incredibly disappointed. The Purple Haze travel spray was a disaster. Within minutes of applying it, my skin started to burn – a deep, insistent heat. It was unbelievably itchy, and my face swelled up, feeling like it was on fire. I’ve had allergies my whole life, and this was the worst. I’ve read online that so many people have severe reactions to this fragrance; it’s clearly not formulated for sensitive skin. I’m terrified of what this is doing to my face!",1
P473666,"Objectively, I find this Invisible Post Eau de Parfum profoundly concerning. As a retired nurse with extensive experience observing dermatological presentations, the combination of Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate and Ethylhexyl Salicylate raises significant flags. Individuals with pre-existing conditions like eczema – particularly those in the 55+ demographic – are exquisitely sensitive to photosensitization. I’ve witnessed firsthand the exacerbation of conditions like psoriasis and melasma with similar compounds. Frankly, it appears a risky proposition for vulnerable skin types.",1
P472300,"Absolutely outrageous pricing! This Capri Eau de Parfum is a complete rip-off! I just saw IDENTICAL bottles – SAME ingredients, I checked! – for HALF the price at another store! Seriously?! This is highway robbery! The scent is okay, I guess, but the price is completely unjustified. Don’t be fooled! You’re being blatantly ripped off! I'm furious! 😡😡😡",1
P473667,"This tiny rollerball is ridiculous. Seriously? 0.25 ounces? It’s utterly inconvenient. I’ve heard it’s been discontinued due to some supposed “safety concerns” – complete nonsense. I just want a decent fragrance, not this miniature hassle. Don’t waste your money. It’s frustrating. I want simple solutions, not tiny, overpriced sprays.",2
